<!--author-->

Support our effort and help us help others. As of now our enterprise is entirely 
private and supported by donations from friends and family. We are in the 
process of registering as a non-profit organization but as of now dontaions to us are non
 tax-decutible. Donations of any kind, particularly monthly recurrent ones, help us sustain 
 and grow the projects. Please consider donating by clicking on [**Venmo**](https://venmo.com/?txn=pay&audience=public&recipients=@ElisabethAdetta-Heynold&note=For%20Elmama%20Kindergarten%20Watamu,%20Kenya) or [**Paypal**](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=2BLC9SYLSQN5W) to follow the links or reach out via [**email**](mailto:elisabeth.heynold@web.de) for  alternative ways of contributing.
